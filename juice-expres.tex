\section{Jovian radio emissions occultation by Ganymede}
\citet{kurth_GRL_97} observed that the Jovian hectometric radio emissions are occulted by Ganymede during G01 flyby (first Ganymede flyby) of the Galileo S/C, on June 27th 1996. Figure \ref{fig:g01} shows the Galileo/PWS (Plasma Waves Science) \citep{gurnett_SSR_92} spectrogram during G01 flyby. The occultation is observed between 05:50 and 06:20 SCET. The occultation spectral ingress and egress profiles imply that radio sources at higher frequencies (located close to Jupiter) are occulted earlier and reappears later than the lower frequency sources (located further out from Jupiter).

We model this occultation using ExPRES. The location of the visible radio sources is modeled every minute of time during the interval displayed on Figure \ref{fig:g01}. Northern and Southern main auroral oval are modeled with active magnetic field lines every 1$^\circ$ on longitude.  We use the JRM09 magnetic field model \citep{Connerney:2018jx} and the magnetic latitude of the active magnetic field lines correspond to $L_\textrm{shell}=30$ \citep{Grodent:2015eo}. The unstable electron temperature set to 5~keV \citep{Louarn:2017bc}. 

The occultation is computed using a simple computation of the intercept distance between the center of Ganymede and the straight lines passing by each radio source and the observer. The occultation estimation uses a simple occultation by the surface of Ganymede: any source with an intercept distance shorter than one Ganymede Radius is occulted, as sketched on Figure \ref{fig:occult}.

%The second occultation estimation includes a model of the Ganymede's ionosphere (e.g., as in Eviatar et al (2001)), and uses the modeled cutoff frequency altitude for each frequency.
